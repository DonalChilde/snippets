# Dev TODO

- rationalize rst heading hash marks
- pros and cons of markdown over rst, esp with project readme.
  - github will not hide directives in markdown files, making includes using the readme.md as source hard.
- Where to have prime version of dev-reference file.
  - maybe have separate project level dev reference file, and occasionally consolidate in master dev-reference.
