# Coding environment on ubuntu

Had to build python 3.7 from source, had to hunt for missing headers for sqlite, and uuid

vscode automatically uses the top folder venv on multiroot workspaces. reorder as needed.

vscode does not properly set PYTHONPATH from .env file, but pipenv does. open new terminal, call pipenv shell to enable proper paths

had to set global git email and user name properties before commits
